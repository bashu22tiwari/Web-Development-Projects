        				<li>
        					At the <b>age of 12</b>, Elon Musk created and <b>sold a video game to a magazine.</b> The space fighting game called ‘Blastar’ was sold to PC and Office Technology magazine for $500. Musk also <b>worked at a gaming start-up called ‘Rocket Science’</b>.
        				</li>
        				<li>
        					Musk’s earliest venture was the <b>founding of Zip2</b>, a company that provided maps and business directories to newspapers and was later <b>sold to Compaq for $307 million.</b>
        				</li>
        				<li>
        					<b>Paypal, erstwhile X.com</b>, was what eventually made Musk his fortune. Founded in 1999 , Paypal was then acquired by Ebay for $1.5 billion, <b>of which $165 million was given to Musk in stocks</b>.
        				</li>
        				<li>
        					In 2002, <b>Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies</b>, better known as <b>SpaceX</b>. Musk was convinced that humanity's survival depended on its ability to become a multi-planetary species, but current rocket launching technologies were too expensive. This he accomplished with the <b>launch of the Falcon 1 in 2006, the Falcon 9 in 2010 and the Falcon Heavy in 2018</b>.
        				</li>
        				<li>
        					The <b>Falcon Heavy</b> was capable of carrying 53,000 kg into orbit, twice as heavy as its closest competitor at nearly one-third the cost.
        				</li>
        				<li>
        					Because of the lack of funding, Musk had to invest his own money into the development of SpaceX rockets. Currently, the <b>company has a $1.6 billion</b> contract with NASA for resupply missions and eventually ferrying people to and from the International Space Station.
        				</li>
        				<li>
        					Musk then became a <b>major funder in Tesla Motors</b>, now called <b>Tesla</b>. Largely uninterested in the electric vehicles then, Tesla introduced the Roadster, a car with futuristic looks and a battery with a range of 394 km on a single charge
        				</li>
        				<li>
